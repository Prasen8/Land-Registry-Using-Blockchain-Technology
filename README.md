# 🏠 Land Registry Using Blockchain Technology
# 📖 Overview :
This project is a web-based decentralized land registry system built using Blockchain technology. It provides a transparent, immutable, and secure method to record and verify land ownership and transaction history.
Developed with Python (Flask), this application simulates how blockchain can revolutionize traditional land registration systems by ensuring trust and preventing data manipulation.

# ✨ Features :
🧱 Immutable Land Records:
Each land record is stored as a “block” in the blockchain. Once added, it cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring complete data integrity.

# 🔗 Tamper-Proof History:
Every block includes a cryptographic hash of the previous block. Any modification breaks the chain, making tampering instantly detectable.

# 💻 User-Friendly Interface:
Intuitive web interface to:

# Add new land records
Search and view specific records by unique ID
Visualize the entire blockchain

# 💾 Persistent Data Storage:
The blockchain is saved in a local blockchain.json file, preserving all records even after restarting the app.

# 📜 Full Blockchain Visualization:
A dedicated page displays all blocks, showing timestamps, owner details, current hash, and previous hash for transparency.
